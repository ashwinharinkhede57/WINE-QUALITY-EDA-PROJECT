his project explores the Wine Quality dataset to understand which chemical properties influence the overall quality of wine. Using Python-based analytical techniques, the project dives into trends, correlations, patterns, and visual insights that help explain what makes a wine “high quality.”

🔍 Objective of the Study

Analyze physicochemical features of wine

Identify variables that strongly correlate with wine quality

Understand distribution, trends, and outliers

Generate useful insights for data-driven decision-making

🧠 Analytics Approach

Data Collection & Understanding

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Histograms, KDE plots

Boxplots, Scatterplots

Correlation heatmaps

Feature Insight Extraction

(Optional) Modeling approach to predict wine quality

🛠 Tools & Technologies

Python

Pandas & NumPy – Data processing

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Visualization

Jupyter Notebook – Analysis environment

📊 Key Visual Insights

Alcohol content shows strong positive influence on quality

pH levels cluster between 3.0–3.6

Sulphates and volatile acidity show significant variation patterns

Quality ratings are mostly between 5 and 6

Bubble charts reveal combined relationships between alcohol, pH, and quality
